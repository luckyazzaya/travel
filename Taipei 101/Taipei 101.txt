Visiting the tallest building in a new city has a natural appeal because it gives us a chance to gain a unique perspective of the city. 
When you come to Taipei 101, you can take the super-high-speed elevator up to the 89th floor and take in the whole city from a special vantage point. 
Up there in the clouds you're sure to be captivated and moved by taking in so much of Taipei and it's surrounding area, whether you visit in the daytime or at night.
